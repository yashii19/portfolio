            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Franco-Algerian, Lyna was born in Paris and grew up in the 93rd district. At just 17, she created the Vraies Meufs platform to show the side of women that is rarely presented in magazines. In an era where we control what we show of ourselves on social media, Lyna meets everyday women, shares their lives, experiences, and opinions, and photographs them without makeup, breaking the social mask. The project generated so much enthusiasm that the young woman was awarded the Influential Women Award in 2018 and collaborated with Nike and Converse.
            </p>
            <p>
                She also hosts the podcast l’Atay (tea in Maghrebi dialect) which addresses societal issues related to dual identity and dual culture and highlights young talents through the show. Since 2019, they have organized various events, dinners, and creator markets open to all during the Ramadan period.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2020, she co-directed Footeuses, a documentary about football culture and women in Paris and its suburbs. The film is part of the "Ballon sur Bitume" documentary series, the first part of which is available on Netflix, and after a cinema release, Footeuses is available for free on YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to her projects, Lyna holds a bachelor's degree in computer science and design and a master's degree in artificial intelligence from Sorbonne University. She works as a freelancer on journalism, creative strategy, social media management, or casting missions.
